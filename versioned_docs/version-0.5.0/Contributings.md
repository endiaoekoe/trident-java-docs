# Contributings


Trident-Java is open to the community. Because of that, Trident-Java grows bigger. It is still welcome to all of you to contribute to it in any way like PRs and issues. And you only need to obey these rules:

- Security is the most important part of this repo. So when you submit an issue of PR, consider it first.
- Be careful to submit backward-compatibility-breaking changes. Most time, they will not be accepted.
- We don't want this repo to be a giant monster that could place a high sill in front of new users.

Finally, we do appreciate that you submit an issue before starting a PR so we can figure out the best way to solve problems.
